Release

Once you have a release ready you'll need to make the corresponding tag. First run a quick pod lib lint then create your tag and push it.

The release workflow is similar to the following.
$ cd ~/code/Pods/NAME
$ edit NAME.podspec
# set the new version to 0.0.1
# set the new tag to 0.0.1
$ pod lib lint

$ git add -A && git commit -m "Release 0.0.1."
$ git tag '0.0.1'
$ git push --tags
Submitting Open Source Code
Once your tags are pushed you can use the command:

pod trunk push OKTextFieldView.podspec
